# Social-Buzz-Data-Analysis-Project
This project is the culmination of my virtual internship with Accenture, where I worked as a data analyst on a project for Social Buzz, a social media and content creation company based in San Francisco.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to help Social Buzz prepare for an upcoming IPO by conducting an audit of their big data practices, providing recommendations for a successful IPO, and analyzing their content categories to identify the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

Throughout the project, I performed various tasks including modeling the data by creating a database schema using MySQL, cleaning the data using MS Excel, analyzing and visualizing the data using PowerBI, and delivering my insights to the client through a Microsoft presentation.

Repository Contents
This repository contains the following files and folders:

SQL: contains the SQL script used to create the database schema for Social Buzz

output: contains the output files generated from the analysis
PowerBI: contains the PowerBI file used for data visualization
